# Background

### Some things to think about when writing software

---

# What is modularity?

### The degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined.

#### Advantages

- Functionality can be dynamically loaded and unloaded depending on the **particular use case** 


- Open source modularity allows **extensions** contributed by many people


- A **flexible system** that can be tailored to keep software easy to use



---

# What else is important?

### Reproducibility

Encourage **best practices** with regards to disclosure of analysis methods in research

### Extensibility

**Expands** into areas that weren't anticipated early in development

- e.g. packages in `R`, macros in Excel, add-ins in JMP

### Ease of use

Help users **avoid frustration**

- e.g., web technologies eliminate local installation, easy to learn GUI

We have an **ulterior motive** to get students excited about programming!

- By navigating about the user interface of `intRo`, students are creating a fully-executable `R` script that they can download and run locally

- Viewing their script change real-time within the application

- This is a sneaky way to **spark curiosity** of students
